    <p><b>Tularam Rajaram Saraswati Vidya Mandir Inter College, Chaiti More Kashipur was inaugurated on July 01, 1986 under the patronage of Mr. Gopal Krishna Mehrotra ji in class 6 through 25 brothers/ sisters at Kila Street. At that time the name of the school was Saraswati Vidya Mandir. Mr. Triloki Nath Gaur was the first Principal of the school, after the tireless efforts of the then Management Committee, Mr. Ramkripal Agarwal, a social worker and education lover, donated land for the school in 1989 in the memory of his father. Saraswati Vidya Mandir is known as Inter College. On which at present there is a huge building with 60 rooms. Brothers/ sisters used to study together in the school till the year 2000. Looking at the need of the time, it was considered that the education system for girls should be separate, for this Taravati Sarojini Devi as a girls' school. Balika Saraswati Vidya Mandir Inter College was started, the school got High School recognition in 1996 and Inter in 1998. Since then, every year 7, 8 students of the school get a place in the priority list of the province. At present, the school has a library, computer room, separate laboratories for physics, chemistry and biology. Arrangements have been made in which basketball, badminton, cricket, volleyball, kabaddi etc. are important. For the personality development of the students, experts are invited to the school from time to time and guided. The Kabaddi team has participated at the international level. Under the guidance of 42 Acharyas and Acharyas in the Vidyalaya, 1200 students are getting cultured education for all round development of personality for their bright future. Again, keeping in view the local requirement, the admission of girl students was started from the current session 2019-20 and in the year 2013, the management committee bought a plot of four bighas adjacent to the school building, on which there is a plan to build a huge room and hostel in the future. . Next, there is a plan to build a mathematics laboratory in the school, which will be built with the help of all the enlightened and philanthropic gentlemen of the society and honorable people's representatives - I hope that the school family will get all kinds of support from all of you, as it has been in the past, in the future as well. Will continue to meet so that the school can touch its heights. And the students getting education in this school can participate in building a strong nation along with their bright future.</b></p>
